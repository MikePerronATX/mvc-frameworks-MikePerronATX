        <hr>
        Skip the Easter egg decorating kit this year. 
        Here’s how make your own egg dye in minutes, using things you probably already 
        have in your pantry.

        <p id="oblIngredients">Ingredients:</p>
        <p>Hard-boiled eggs<br>
        Food coloring<br>
        White vinegar<br><br>
        If You Don’t Have Vinegar: Use lemon juice in place of the vinegar, or just leave the vinegar out. 
        Eggs dyed without vinegar will turn out pastel-colored. You need a mild acid, like vinegar or 
        lemon juice to achieve really vibrant colors. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</p>

        <h3 class="titleColorAbout">Homemade Easter Egg Dyes</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Measure 1/2 cup of the boiling water into a canning jar or another heat-resistant container. 
        Then, add one teaspoon of vinegar and 10-20 drops of food coloring to achieve your desired color. 
        Repeat the process to create additional colors. We used neon food coloring to make most of the 
        colors that you see here. If you’re working with small kids, allow the dye to cool before you 
        move on to dying eggs.</p>

        <p>Place eggs in your dye, and allow them to soak for around five minutes. You’ll probably need 
        to flip your eggs partway through, so that both sides are evenly colored.</p>

        <h3 class="titleColorAbout">Carton of Eggs Dyed Without a Kit</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>To give you an idea of what sorts of colors you can achieve, we dipped a brown egg and a white 
        egg in each color. Those are brown eggs on the right side of the carton and white eggs on the 
        left side.</p>

        <h3 class="titleColorAbout">Egg Covered in Stickers</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>If you want to get fancy, you can do some color-blocking by placing stickers on the eggs before 
        you drop them into the dye. We had some spring-themed foam stickers on hand, so that’s what we 
        used. Regular stickers would work just as well.</p>

        <h3 class="titleColorAbout">How to Store Your Dyed Easter Eggs</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Place your finished eggs back in their carton, and allow them to dry completely, before you move 
        them to the refrigerator.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 id="tipColor">Tip:</h3>
        <p id="tipColor-text">When you take your eggs out of the fridge, allow them to dry before you handle them. This 
        will keep the colors from smearing or running.</p>
